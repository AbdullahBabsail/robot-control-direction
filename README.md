# robot-control-direction

An interface to control the direction of the robot movement. By clicking one of the directions buttons a single character f, b, l, r, s is sent to the PHP page

This controller web page does nothing when you click on any arrow because it still does not have the functionalities and it is not connected to the real robot yet.
